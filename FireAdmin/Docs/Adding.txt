Extending FireAdmin

Preface: This is a living document, meaning it will grow and change as time goes by. I am using it as a 'scratchpad' to record notes for myself, and perhaps someday, YOU. It contains snippets and shoirtcuts to make developing for FireAdmin easier and faster.


[[Adding a new command button to FireAdmin]]
Broadly, in order to add a button with a command, four steps are required (in toc order):
-make tooltips and button text localised in ./Locales/xxxx.lua
-write the function in ./Commands/Commands_xxxx.lua
-prototype/init the button, function, text, and tooltip in FunctionInit.lua
-Draw the button in the ./Frames/MangFrames_Sectionxxxx.lua
